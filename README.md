I've created a complete step-by-step Python guide designed specifically for a 10-year-old! It includes:
What's inside:

20 progressive lessons from absolute basics to advanced concepts
Clear explanations with kid-friendly language
Hands-on examples and practice challenges
6 fun projects including games and useful tools
Emojis and friendly encouragement throughout

The learning path covers:

Level 1-3: Basics (printing, variables, if statements, loops)
Level 4-5: Lists and functions
Level 6: Fun game projects
Level 7-8: Advanced topics (dictionaries, classes, error handling)
Final projects to build real things!

Each lesson builds on the previous one, so they can work through it at their own pace. The projects are designed to be fun and engaging while teaching important concepts.
Would you like me to expand on any particular section, add more projects, or create practice exercises for specific topics?
